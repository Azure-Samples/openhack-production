# Working agreement

A **Working Agreement** is a living document representing the principles and expected behavior of everyone involved in the project; it is not meant to be exhaustive nor complete. The team should be accountable to these standards and revisit, review, and revise as needed. The agreement is signed off by everyone. 

## Working Together

- Attend all planning and standup meetings whenever possible. If we will not be able to attend a meeting, we will let the Scrum Master and/or Product Manager as soon as possible. 
- Be on time for meetings and give our full attention for the meeting's duration. 
- We have blameless team culture and we will not use blaming words. For example, we will avoid “You broke this” or “You messed up”, and instead ask “How did this break?”, “Why did this break?”, “What steps broke it?”, “How do we prevent this?”, “How can I help?” 
- Don't use bias language, Guys can be replace by "Y'all" or "You all"
 

## Coding Together

- We will be responsible for the work we do individually and as a team, collectively. 
- Create software at the end of each iteration 
- Design reviews and architecture reviews are case-by-case and determined by team. 


## Pull Requests 

- Keep PR's as small as possible 
- When someone is tagged to review a PR, they must reply to the request within 24 hours. 
 

## The Scrum Master will: 

- Team will have rotating scrum master 
- Drive standup/planning/retro meetings and hold team accountable for attendance and participation. 
- Keep the meeting moving: 
  - What you did yesterday 
  - What you are going to do today 
  - Blockers
